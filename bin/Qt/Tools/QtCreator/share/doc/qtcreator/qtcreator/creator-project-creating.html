<h1 class="title">Creating Projects</h1>
<!-- $$$creator-project-creating.html-description -->
<div class="descr" id="details">
<p>Creating a project enables you to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Group files together</li>
<li>Add custom build steps</li>
<li>Include forms and resource files</li>
<li>Specify settings for running applications</li>
</ul>
<p>When you set up a new project in Qt Creator, a wizard guides you step-by-step through the process. The wizard templates prompt you to enter the settings that you need for that particular type of project and create the necessary files for you. You can add your own custom wizards to standardize the way of adding subprojects and classes to a project.</p>
<p>Most Qt Creator project wizards enable you to choose the build system to use for building the project: qmake, CMake, or Qbs. If you do not get to choose, the project uses qmake as the build system.</p>
<p>You can use wizards also to create plain C or C++ projects that use qmake, Qbs, or CMake, but do not use the Qt library.</p>
<p>In addition, you can import projects as <i>generic projects</i> that do not use qmake, Qbs, or CMake. This enables you to use Qt Creator as a code editor and to fully control the steps and commands used to build the project.</p>
<p>You can install tools for <a href="creator-glossary.html#glossary-device">devices</a> as part of Qt distributions. The installers create <a href="creator-glossary.html#glossary-buildandrun-kit">kits</a> and specify build and run settings for the installed device types. However, you might need to install and configure some additional software on the devices to be able to connect to them from the development PC.</p>
<h2 id="selecting-the-build-system">Selecting the Build System</h2>
<p>You can use several build systems to build your projects.</p>
<p>qmake is a cross-platform system for build automation that helps simplify the build process for development projects across different platforms. qmake automates the generation of build configurations so that you need only a few lines of information to create each configuration. Qt installers install and configure qmake. To use one of the other supported build systems, you need to set it up.</p>
<p>CMake is an alternative to qmake for automating the generation of build configurations. For more information, see <a href="creator-project-cmake.html">Setting Up CMake</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://mesonbuild.com/">Meson</a> Meson is a fast and user-friendly open-source build system that aims to minimize the time developers spend writing or debugging build definitions and waiting for the build system to start compiling code. For more information, see <a href="creator-project-meson.html">Setting Up Meson</a>.</p>
<p>Qbs is an all-in-one build tool that generates a build graph from a high-level project description (like qmake or CMake do) and executes the commands in the low-level build graph (like make does). For more information, see <a href="creator-project-qbs.html">Setting Up Qbs</a>.</p>
<p>To change the location of the project directory, and to specify settings for building and running projects, select <b>Edit</b> &gt; <b>Preferences</b> &gt; <b>Build &amp; Run</b> &gt; <b>General</b>.</p>
<p>Specify build and run settings for different target platforms, in the <b>Projects</b> mode. For more information on the options you have, see <a href="creator-build-settings.html">Specifying Build Settings</a>.</p>
<h2 id="using-project-wizards">Using Project Wizards</h2>
<p>In the first step, you select a template for the project. You can filter templates (1) to view only those that apply to a particular target platform.</p>
<p class="centerAlign"><img src="images/qtcreator-new-project.png" alt="" /></p><p>Next, you select a location for the project and specify settings for it.</p>
<p>When you have completed the steps, Qt Creator automatically generates the project with required headers, source files, user interface descriptions and project files, as defined by the wizard.</p>
<p>For example, if you choose to create a Qt Quick application, Qt Creator generates a QML file that you can modify in the <b>Edit</b> mode.</p>
<h2 id="selecting-project-type">Selecting Project Type</h2>
<p>The following table lists the wizard templates for creating projects.</p>
<div class="table"><table class="generic">

<h3 id="creating-widget-based-qt-for-python-applications">Creating Widget-Based Qt for Python Applications</h3>
<p><a href="https://doc.qt.io/qtforpython/index.html">Qt for Python</a> enables you to use Qt 6 API in Python applications. You can use the PySide6 modules to gain access to individual Qt modules, such as Qt Core, Qt GUI, and Qt Widgets.</p>
<p>If you have not installed PySide6, Qt Creator prompts you to install it after you create the project. Further, it prompts you to install the <a href="creator-language-servers.html#python-language-server">Python language server</a> that provides services such as code completion and annotations. Select <b>Install</b> to install PySide6 and the language server.</p>
<p>To view and manage the available Python interpreters, select <b>Edit</b> &gt; <b>Preferences</b> &gt; <b>Python</b> &gt; <b>Interpreters</b>.</p>
<p class="centerAlign"><img src="images/qtcreator-python-interpreters.png" alt="&quot;Python Interpreters in Preferences&quot;" /></p><p>You can add and remove interpreters and clean up references to interpreters that you uninstalled, but that still appear in the list. In addition, you can set the interpreter to use by default.</p>
<p>The Qt for Python Application wizards generate a <code>.pyproject</code> file that lists the files in the Python project and a <code>.py</code> file that contains some boilerplate code. In addition, the widget-based UI wizard creates a <code>.ui</code> file that contains a Qt Designer form, and the Qt Quick Application wizard creates a <code>.qml</code> file that contains Qt Quick controls.</p>
<p>The <code>.pyproject</code> files are JSON-based configuration files that replace the previously used <code>.pyqtc</code> configuration files. You can still open and use <code>.pyqtc</code> files, but we recommend that you choose <code>.pyproject</code> files for new projects.</p>
<p>The <b>Window UI</b> wizard enables you to create a Python project that contains the source file for a class. Specify the PySide version, class name, base class, and and source file for the class.</p>
<p class="centerAlign"><img src="images/qtcreator-python-wizard-app-window.png" alt="&quot;Qt for Python wizard for creating a widget-based UI&quot;" /></p><p>The wizard adds the imports to the source file to provide access to the QApplication, the base class you selected in the Qt Widgets module, and Qt UI tools:</p>
<pre class="cpp plain">
 import sys

 from PySide6.QtWidgets import QApplication, QWidget
</pre>
<div class="admonition note">
<p><b>Note: </b>It is important that you first create the Python code from your UI form. In PySide6, you can do this by executing <code>pyside6-uic form.ui -o ui_form.py</code> on a terminal. This enables you to import the class that represents your UI from that Python file.</p>
</div>
<p>Once you generate the Python code from the UI file, you can import the class:</p>
<pre class="cpp plain">
 from ui_form import Ui_Widget
</pre>
<p>The wizard also adds a main class with the specified name that inherits from the specified base class:</p>
<pre class="cpp plain">
 class Widget(QWidget):
     def __init__(self, parent=None):
         super().__init__(parent)
</pre>
<p>The following lines in the main class instantiate the generated Python class from your UI file, and set up the interface for the current class.</p>
<pre class="cpp plain">
 self.ui = Ui_Widget()
 self.ui.setupUi(self)
</pre>
<div class="admonition note">
<p><b>Note: </b>You can access the UI elements of the new class as member variables. For example, if you have a button called <i>button1</i>, you can interact with it using <code>self.ui.button1</code>.</p>
</div>
<p>Next, the wizard adds a main function, where it creates a QApplication instance. As Qt can receive arguments from the command line, you can pass any arguments to the QApplication object. Usually, you do not need to pass any arguments, and you can use the following approach:</p>
<pre class="cpp plain">
 if __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;:
     app = QApplication(sys.argv)
</pre>
<p>Next, the wizard instantiates the <code>MainWindow</code> class and shows it:</p>
<pre class="cpp plain">
 widget = Widget()
 widget.show()
 ..&#x2e;
</pre>
<p>Finally, the wizard calls the <code>app.exec()</code> method to enter the Qt main loop and start executing the Qt code:</p>
<pre class="cpp plain">
 sys.exit(app.exec())
</pre>
<p>You can now modify the boilerplate code in the Edit mode to develop your Python application. Select <b>REPL</b> on the toolbar to start the <a href="https://pythonprogramminglanguage.com/repl/">Python interactive shell</a>. To start the shell and import the current file as a module, select select <b>REPL Import File</b>. To also import all functions from the file, select <b>REPL Import *</b>.</p>
<p>Always regenerate the Python code after modifying a UI file.</p>
<p>Open the .ui file in the <b>Design</b> mode to create a widget-based UI in Qt Designer.</p>
<p>The <b>Window</b> wizard adds similar code to the source file, without the UI bits.</p>
<p>The <b>Empty</b> wizard adds similar code to the source file, but it does not add any classes, so you need to add and instantiate them yourself.</p>
<p>For more information about the <b>Qt for Python - Qt Quick Application - Empty</b> wizard, see <a href="quick-projects.html#creating-qt-quick-based-python-applications">Creating Qt Quick Based Python Applications</a>.</p>
<p>For examples of creating Qt for Python applications, see <a href="https://doc.qt.io/qtforpython/tutorials/index.html">Qt for Python Examples and Tutorials</a>.</p>
<h2 id="specifying-project-contents">Specifying Project Contents</h2>
<p>A project can contain files that should be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Compiled or otherwise handled by the build</li>
<li>Installed</li>
<li>Not installed, but included in a source package created with <code>make dist</code></li>
<li>Not installed, nor be part of a source package, but still be known to Qt Creator</li>
</ul>
<p>Qt Creator displays all files that you declare to be part of the project by the project files in the <a href="creator-projects-view.html">Projects</a> view. It sorts the files into categories by file type (.cpp, .h, .qrc, and so on). To display additional files, edit the project file. Alternatively, you can see all the files in a project directory in the <a href="creator-file-system-view.html">File System</a> view.</p>
<p>Declaring files as a part of the project also makes them visible to the <a href="creator-editor-locator.html">locator</a> and <a href="creator-editor-finding.html#advanced-search">project-wide search</a>.</p>
<h3 id="cmake-projects">CMake Projects</h3>
<p>When using CMake, you can specify additional files for a project by either adding them as sources or installing them.</p>
<p>In the CMakeLists.txt file, define the files as values of the <a href="https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/target_sources.html">target_sources</a> command using the <code>PRIVATE</code> property, for example.</p>
<p>You can prevent CMake from handling some files, such as a .cpp file that should not be compiled. Use the <a href="https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/set_property.html">set_property</a> command and the <a href="https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/prop_sf/HEADER_FILE_ONLY.html">HEADER_FILE_ONLY</a> property to specify such files. For example:</p>
<pre class="cpp plain">
 set_property(SOURCE &quot;${files}&quot; PROPERTY HEADER_FILE_ONLY ON)
</pre>
<p>Alternatively, to install the files, use the <a href="https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/install.html">install</a> command with the <code>FILES</code> or <code>DIRECTORY</code> property.</p>
<h3 id="qmake-projects">qmake Projects</h3>
<p>Use the following variables in the .pro file:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>SOURCES</code> and <code>HEADERS</code> for files to compile</li>
<li><code>INSTALLS</code> for files to install</li>
<li><code>DISTFILES</code> for files to include in a source package</li>
<li><code>OTHER_FILES</code> for files to manage with Qt Creator without installing them or including them in source packages</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, the following value includes text files in the source package:</p>
<pre class="cpp plain">
 DISTFILES += *.txt
</pre>
<h2 id="adding-subprojects-to-projects">Adding Subprojects to Projects</h2>
<p>In addition to Qt libraries, you can link your application to other libraries, such as system libraries or your own libraries. Further, your own libraries might link to other libraries. To be able to compile your project, you must add the libraries to your project. This also enables code completion and syntax highlighting for the libraries. The procedure of adding a library to a project depends on the build system that you use.</p>
<h3 id="cmake-projects">CMake Projects</h3>
<p>You can add CMakeLists.txt files to any project by using the <a href="https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/add_subdirectory.html">add_subdirectory</a> command. The files can define complete projects that you include into the top-level project or any other CMake commands.</p>
<h3 id="qmake-projects">qmake Projects</h3>
<p>When you create a new project and select qmake as the build system, you can add it to another project as a subproject in the <b>Project Management</b> dialog. However, the root project must specify that qmake uses the <code>subdirs</code> template to build the project.</p>
<p>To create a root project, select <b>File</b> &gt; <b>New Project</b> &gt; <b>Other Project</b> &gt; <b>Subdirs Project</b> &gt; <b>Choose</b>.</p>
<p>On the <b>Summary</b> page, select <b>Finish &amp; Add Subproject</b> to create the root project and to add another project, such as a C++ library.</p>
<p>The wizard creates a project file (.pro) that defines a <code>subdirs</code> template and the subproject that you add as a value of the SUBDIRS variable. It also adds all the necessary files for the subproject.</p>
<p>To create more subprojects, right-click the project name in the <b>Projects</b> view to open the context menu, and select <b>New Subproject</b>. Follow the steps in the <b>New Subproject</b> wizard to create a subproject.</p>
<p class="centerAlign"><img src="images/qtcreator-new-qt-quick-project.png" alt="" /></p><p>To add an existing project as a subproject, select <b>Add Existing Projects</b> in the context menu. In the file browser dialog, locate your subproject.</p>
<p>To remove subprojects, right-click the project name in the <b>Projects</b> view, and select <b>Remove Subproject</b> in the context menu.</p>
<p>To specify dependencies, use the <b>Add Library</b> wizard. For more information, see <a href="creator-project-qmake-libraries.html">Adding Libraries to Projects</a>.</p>
<h2 id="binding-keyboard-shortcuts-to-wizards">Binding Keyboard Shortcuts to Wizards</h2>
<p>If you use a wizard regularly, you can bind a custom keyboard shortcut to it. Triggering this keyboard shortcut directly opens the wizard, so you do not need to navigate to <b>File</b> &gt; <b>New File</b> or <b>New Project</b>.</p>
<p>Set keyboard shortcuts for wizards in <b>Edit</b> &gt; <b>Preferences</b> &gt; <b>Environment</b> &gt; <b>Keyboard</b> &gt; <b>Wizard</b>. All wizard actions start with <b>Impl</b> there.</p>
