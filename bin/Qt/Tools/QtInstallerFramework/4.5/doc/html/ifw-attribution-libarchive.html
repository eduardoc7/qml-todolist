 The libarchive distribution as a whole is Copyright by Tim Kientzle
 and is subject to the copyright notice reproduced at the bottom of
 this file.

 Each individual file in this distribution should have a clear
 copyright/licensing statement at the beginning of the file.  If any do
 not, please let me know and I will rectify it.  The following is
 intended to summarize the copyright status of the individual files;
 the actual statements in the files are controlling.

 * Except as listed below, all C sources (including .c and .h files)
   and documentation files are subject to the copyright notice reproduced
   at the bottom of this file.

 * The following source files are also subject in whole or in part to
   a 3-clause UC Regents copyright; please read the individual source
   files for details:
    libarchive/archive_read_support_filter_compress.c
    libarchive/archive_write_add_filter_compress.c
    libarchive/mtree.5

 * The following source files are in the public domain:
    libarchive/archive_getdate.c

 * The following source files are triple-licensed with the ability to choose
   from CC0 1.0 Universal, OpenSSL or Apache 2.0 licenses:
    libarchive/archive_blake2.h
    libarchive/archive_blake2_impl.h
    libarchive/archive_blake2s_ref.c
    libarchive/archive_blake2sp_ref.c

 * The build files---including Makefiles, configure scripts,
   and auxiliary scripts used as part of the compile process---have
   widely varying licensing terms.  Please check individual files before
   distributing them to see if those restrictions apply to you.

 I intend for all new source code to use the license below and hope over
 time to replace code with other licenses with new implementations that
 do use the license below.  The varying licensing of the build scripts
 seems to be an unavoidable mess.
